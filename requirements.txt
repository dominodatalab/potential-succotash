# Some Python examples in this project require additional packages. These
# packages are being installed via this requirements file as a convenience for
# environments that don't have them pre-installed.
#
# Files named requirements.txt will automatically be installed at the begining
# of any workspace, job or App. This file is manually loaded in the Flask and
# Dash Apps in this project as those are the only files requiring these
# packages.
#
# This method of installing Python packages is convenient, but for faster
# launches, it is recommended to add packages to the Compute Environment
# instead of using a requirements.txt file.
#
# See https://docs.dominodatalab.com/en/latest/reference/environments/Environment_management.html
# for instructions.
